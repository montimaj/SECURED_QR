Generate QR code from various files and verify the authenticity of the file using digital signature.

The digital signatute scheme has been implemented using:

-> Encryption Algorithm: RSA

-> Hash Algorithm: SHA-1

-> Keysize: 3072-bit

System requirements for PC:

-> Linux

-> JDK 1.7 or above

-> GTK+

-> gtkdialog

-> zenity

Start the GUI by executing start.sh via the terminal(Ex:  foo@bar:~$ sh start.sh )
Alternatively change the permission of 'start.sh' & make it executable($ chmod +x start.sh) for once. Then like any other app, just double click on start.sh to run the GUI.
